### The Artist
Ezekwesiri Enyinnaya Obioha is a music artist that records and performs under the name ZehkEzehk. While in Holland, the Dutch people could not pronounce his name Ezekwesiri. So he shortened it to Ezehk. Some then called him Ezehk while others called him Zehk. In creating his artist name, he joined Zehk to Ezehk and came up with ZehkEzehk. Ezekwesiri means that “it fits him to be the king,” Enyinnaya means “he is his father's friend” and Obioha means “the heart of all.” Raised in Port Harcourt (Rivers State) and currently residing in Nkwerre (Imo State), ZehkEzehk focuses mostly on the genres afro R&B, afro hip hop and highlife in Igbo and English and can also sing in Dutch and Spanish. His audience can expect a performance of a story teller who uses various creativities to entertain. His audience will laugh, dance and sing-along with him. In most of his shows, tears of joy greet the audience while sweet memories follow and remain with them till his next stage performance.

### The Music
ZehkEzehk makes music because songs come to him as if prophecy, he receives songs as messages as well as receiving the beats and video-clip scripts. He only feels relieved when he delivers that message in form of a song. He wishes everyone Success4All, that everyone gets equal opportunity to showcase their talents, achieve their goals and be happy in life.

### Vision & Mission
His vision is to see vital life-changing messages conveyed through music and people getting informed while they are being entertained and his mission is to become great through his talents as well as help upcoming talents achieve greatness with strong encouragement.

His singing voice is a natural voice which can vary depending on the song and raps as well, which he performs with instrumental tracks. He is also a talented actor, dancer and storyteller.

### Goals & Purpose
Music and other arts he deems important to the society because music is said to be the opium of life, which can also be said about art in general. Music provides a unique opportunity to convey hard messages in a simplified way. Music and art help people inner-stand life, feel happy and live long. Art helps him forget his sorrows, clear thoughts and meditate. When asking ZehkEzehk how he defines success as an artist he said; “It is often said that the artist should not focus on money-making. I don't believe that, as well as I want to convey my messages through music and reach a large audience, I also want to make lots of money to defend the popularity that is associated with success.” As an entertaining messenger, the purpose of his music is to reach the whole world with eye-opening messages while making them happy. As one of the LastMessengerS, his songs convey messages of truth, hope, peace, unity, harmony and love. His songs are written to heal our societies and the world in general.

ZehkEzehk develops his skills by the motto of "practice makes perfect" and has the habit of singing his songs audibly and non-audibly. Creating beats in his mind and humming with his mouth surely keeps him busy. He also has this talent of being able to sing with every given topic or story. All these creative engagements have helped him to constantly develop his skills. He embraces feedback from critics and music lovers because he is very open to every feedback as it helps him better himself and receives lots of positive encouragements. As an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) expert as well as a project developer, he has the ultimate career goal of establishing a Computer Assembly Plant and Solar Energy industry to help provide constant and affordable electricity for African homes.

As an artist his ultimate career goal is to reach a very large audience with positive and correctional messages while earning the money needed to run his ICT and Solar Energy industries.

### Influences
Growing up his music really came from within but always enjoyed popular artists like Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Steve Wonder and Tina Turner and today mostly listens to African highlife, R&B, Langwa and afro hip hop. When asked what motivates him to create, he answered; “Creativity for me, music offers me the opportunity to independently express my inner-self, communicate my feelings and share my passion with others.” He finds inspiration in nature, in his experiences, the stories of others and history.

### History
He started music in 1985 in Aba, the commercial city of Abia State in Igboland. As a young lad who just left school, he had no money to pay for studio time and a producer to produce his "demo tape" as it was then called. He then spoke to some of his musically talented friends and they agreed partner together as a musical group.
They then formed a musical group called CVH (Clinton, Victor and Henry) and started writing, composing and singing together as each person sang their own song with the others on the chorus. The lack of fund was still a serious hindrance for them to make it to the studio. They finally saved enough money for the long-awaited studio recording and were able to produce a few tracks championed by Shake Your Body, a track that was written by Clinton and composed by all three members of CVH.

Armed with a demo, they now tried all they could to get signed by record labels but never succeeded until the group gave up on music as each person went for a different career. Clinton continued music-making, Victor started learning a trade while he left for Lagos were he got a job as a clearing & forwarding agent at Murtala Muhammad Airport in Lagos.

Although he continued writing songs, he saw no opportunity or hope of ever producing his songs. Years passed by without him seeing his musical colleagues or having the prospect of producing even a single track. Finally he gave up his musical career and focused fully on his job.

In 1991 he got the opportunity to travel to Europe via ship from Equatorial Guinea which he grabbed. He went to Equatorial Guinea where he spent eight months waiting for the ship to Spain. During this time he got a street-musician as friend and together started writing and composing songs. It was then that he wrote and composed many songs, among which LoveTonic. The time finally came for the ship to leave for Spain. He made it as one of the lucky few to go on board to travel. After sixteen nights on the Atlantic Ocean, they arrived in Valencia in Spain on the 17th day of their voyage.

To cut a long story short, he lived in Spain and Germany without any opportunity to produce the numerous songs he wrote and composed while on transit. He did not relent and moved from Germany to The Netherlands where got married to a Dutch lady and after a while received the Dutch residence and working permits. Once relaxed again he secured a job and worked hard and saved. He made and saved enough money to hire a professional studio and his producer Peter Van Earden. Together with Peter van Earden he worked out and created his single called LoveTonic. It has taken 21 years before being able to release LoveTonic to the world on February 2022. Why it took 21 years to release LoveTonic is a story for another day.
