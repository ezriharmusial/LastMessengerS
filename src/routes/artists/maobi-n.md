Growing up he was singing at home with his family as a family choir, taking themselves to heaven and back with songs as his angels-harp voiced chorister mum would often take the lead and all other family members would add backup voices and even adlibs. He finds inspiration like in a chemistry lab, new elements can be created by mixing up two or more already existing ones. He also gets inspired by realities and mixes that up with his imagination in order to create his own new worlds.

### History
His music career started formally in a competition in 2010 during his last year in Secondary school between himself and his rapper classmate friend to prove that he too can create music as part of a "I can do whatever I set my heart to do" mindset. It was on a Friday and the deal was, compose a song before Monday. He had to scratch his mind and soul to try to create his own original music for the first time in his entire life. Fortunately by Monday he came back to the gathering singing not one but two of his just composed original songs titled Dreams World and Together As One. Ever since he has been making songs with strong and deep messages with the aim to have a strong powerful positive impact on the lives of his people and first developed his skills as a cinematographer through the production of his music videos as well.
