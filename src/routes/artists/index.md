LastMessengerS Music is connecting Musical Talents, Managers, Promoters, Marketers and ICT/Media professionals together so as to reach the world with vital and positive messages.

Granted, so many important messages are begging to be delivered to the public; however, our modern artists have deviated from the main goals of music which are; revelations, prophecies and truths.  

LastMessengerS are restoring one of the ancient music values~TRUTH, by packaging messages as enjoyable songs targeting the curious ears of the general public.

LastMessengerS is raising funds for the production of music albums and video clips for music artists who through their songs inspire the general public towards positive change for a better world. 

In order to raise the funds for this, LastMessengerS organises fundraising events and releases unity-album where every artist contributes a song.
