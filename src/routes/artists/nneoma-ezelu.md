Her main musical influence came from her father who was always singing and popular artists like Dolly Parton, Don Moen, Sinach and Frank Edward and mostly listens to sentimental songs. What motivates her to create is to spread a message of love, peace in readiness and preparedness for the kingdom of heaven on earth. Growing up she wrote poems and turned some of them into songs and has written and sang many songs, both circular and gospel songs, from the time she was a little girl. Her songs revolved around nature, love and life. Music has always been very important to her. She finds inspiration from circumstances and from nature.

### Herstory
Her story started in 1965 and many of her friends thought she was going to turn out a great singer and she always believed that her songs would heal the world and usher in the kingdom of heaven upon the earth. Unfortunately she was not able to push through with her desire because of the environment she came from and all its impediments.

When she got married in 1990, she had hope that her husband's ministry as an evangelist was going to give her the pedestal to fulfill her dream but that changed when in 1992, they left the mainstream Christianity to seek for the truth. But kept writing and singing in the house.

She has written many songs. Some for her school use and others for groups. In 2012 her children encouraged her to go to the studio and put something on record for posterity and five songs came out. She reached out to many music marketers in Aba and Lagos but they told her that her songs sounded foreign to what they sell in the market.
Now being a grandmother and an elder, her ambition is to reach out to the world with her message of bringing back Eden on the earth through total obedience to Yah and love for humanity as an excerpt of one of her songs says; "Adam left as one man, we are going back a great nation"

HalleluYah!
