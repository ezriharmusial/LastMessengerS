### History

He experienced rejection and humiliation which he thinks may have been for not being good enough then. Later he experienced that he made people who listened to his music so happy and they see him as a professional artist now. 

He has been battling with the choice of being a musician or focusing on his course of civil engineering, which he studied in university. He is now ready for music full-time because that is where his passions and destiny are.

Though he has been persecuted by parents and family, he has never given up because he knows that he is in line with his destiny. Following his consistency and hard work, his parents and family have finally accepted him and what he does now, because he has proven to them what it means to be a true musician with passion. 

He has released 3 professional tracks so far and the tracks were produced by himself in 2022. Chuzzykeys is looking forward to having his first ever album released.

Thank you.
