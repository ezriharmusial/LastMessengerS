Although still young, I have witnessed what my mum and other mums go through while caring for their Children. Since I have no other better way of expressing my profound gratitude towards my mother in

particular and all mothers in general, I decided to use my Chi'Ukwu-Okike given talent as a music producer and a musical artist. My song Cradle reminds everyone of the need to value and praise our mothers

everyday and always. Every woman deserves our respect.
