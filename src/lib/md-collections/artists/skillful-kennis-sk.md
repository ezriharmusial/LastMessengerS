history: >-
  He grew up in a hood we're everyone, never believed in music, cux they don't
  know what is called talent.


  When he observed that nobody really wanna listen to what he's saying in his hood, he had to start chasing his dreams secretly. A lot of people always discouraged him to make music, that he was fooling myself, that's makes all to stop talking to him cause they thought that ain't hustling that he's doing music every day at home, but no money.


  He told his father that he's doing music and he said, let the music kill me, that he don't know what his son was doing for over 4 years. He came out from high school, was called a fool and told to be useless, ain't doing nothing, that all the effort made was in vain and that he was disowned as a son, let the music kill you.


  He had no option than to go out from the house and changed his phone number, we're no one can contact him. Got confused in life, not knowing how to start. After all thanking the creator, cause he made a way for him to start rapping. Now his dream finally is coming through.


  He grew up with a traditional titled man, was called his life helper. The Creator valued talent, always encouraged him to work hard, always proved his needs, ever since he started knowing about life and his days of living based on thinking, that's why his motto says, that he thinks all the time.


  H traveled to Lagos on September the 17th of 2021 to Kennis Music Record Label to meet with Mr Kehinde Keeny Ogungbe after having a risky conversation with him, he was told that Kennis Music Record Label ain't record label anymore. That if he didn't get out from here he was going to be arrested. He went home, the next day he traveled back to Imo State to make another plan on how to pursue his dreams and make it come through.


  He came back and started posting on Instagram and kept on doing music every day. Hoping that one day he would see himself into his dreams. Kept on praying to the Creator for him to make a way to gonna start rapping.


  Finally the Creator answered his prayers on a beautiful morning when a guy on the street saw him practicing his music by himself. He came to him and said that he was gonna help him. At first thought it was a joke, but went to meet his brother and that's when my dreams started turning into reality.
