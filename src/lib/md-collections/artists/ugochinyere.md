Growing up she watched the Destiny Kids Of Nigeria minister in different ways with their great songs. She was a big fan and started dreaming of becoming like them. She often performed their songs while singing alone. She started dreaming of climbing a stage one day to sing and grew in this mentality. She had her first public performance in her local church where she grew from an ordinary choir member to a choir moderator and led her team to a series of competitions of which some were won.

Discovering her true self she left the church and decided to start making her own songs. It was a difficult task for her since she couldn't figure out how and where to start but found her way in using her talents working together with other artists that like her musically protest against injustice towards her people. This is where she first made impact as an artist and now had her own stories to tell courtesy of the marginalization, killing and forceful disappearance of her people. She finds inspiration in her dreams, during her depressive moments and during her meditative moments, her story, her people, the universe and her way of life.

Music and other arts she deems important to the society because art makes the society lively and also contributes to the buildup of every society. Art helps her in other parts of life as well as her everyday life is filled with arts.
