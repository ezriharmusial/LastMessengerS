He joined a group called Zoj Boys in the year 2001 when they released a single titled On My Own. He pulled out of the group because he couldn't see the light in it.

Two years later he came up with the album Jah Say No when he was known as Sicoraps at a time when reggae music started losing popularity in Nigeria. He then decided to move out to a foreign land to continue his musical carrier. When he got to Côte d'Ivoire in 2006, he joined the live band group The Morning Stars and was well known for copyrighting Lucky Dube on stage.

That is when he choose the name Da Reggae Priest, because the holy book made it clear that living in truth and holiness attracts the presence of Yah Almighty and his love shall rest upon you to give you the maximum strength and protection needed in all you do.

Yah bless.
