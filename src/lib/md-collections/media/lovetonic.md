quote: Palm wine is LoveTonic
excerpt: With frustrating dismay, I have observed how Oyibo (the whites)
  succeeded in replacing our natural alcoholic Palm wines (Nkwu na Ngwo) drinks
  with their artificial drinks like Beer, Minerals, Malt, Hots, Wine etc.  I
  realized that Oyibo's gradual but steady replacement of our natural gifts with
  their artificial products has eaten deep into the marrow of Igbo people in
  particular and Africans in general.  I then decided to sing about this
  intentional CULTural damage done against Igbo people and Africans.  The whites
  (Oyibo) who have secretly been poisoning Africans (so-called blacks) did
  everything possible to prevent Africans from drinking the breast-milk of
  Nature (Palm wine) and get healed.  Through LoveTonic, I remind Africans that
  they have all been duped by Oyibo.

(Verse 1)
Inside my body,
It pains me so much,
Oh girl I'm dying,
And I feel afraid to let go.

Run through my spine,
Now cause,
I am not, I am not sorry,
For loving you, no.
No, no more.

(Bridge)

Girl, what have you given me?
Cause I'm some kind of a dove.
I know, it's a mixture,
Of love and care.

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl.
(couldn't hear it well)
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic.
Girl, girl.

(Verse 2)
Before we (couldn't hear it well)
In a place in your love.
For better or worse,
From my heart,
I would like to say,
(couldn't hear it well) young girl,
I will, will always be,
By, by your side, sugar.

(Bridge)
Girl, what have you given me?
Cause I'm some kind of a dove.
I know, it's a mixture,

Of love and care.

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl.
(couldn't hear it well)
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic.
Girl, girl.

(Rap)
Just woke up alone,Â 
Pride and joy like an Irish boy.
I love with my soul, sugar.
Living in the narrate of my voice,
I do feel, a better man.
For better or worse,
Come with me girl.
I promise.

(Verse 3)
What did you give to me?
It's good for me.
Oh girl I confess,
From my heart,
I do say, thank you.

From this way up hill,
In my soul.

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl.
(couldn't hear it well)
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic.
Girl, girl.

(Finale)
Can't you see you make me feel good.
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic.
Girl, girl,
Girl, girl,
Lovely,
Baby,
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl.
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl.
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic.
Love Tonic, I have the Love Tonic.
Love Tonic, I am the Love Tonic.
Love Tonic, I am the Love Tonic.
