quote: A'bum nwa Anyanwu [I am the son of the Sun]
excerpt: I made this song called Anyanwu, cause the music really expresses how I
  feel inside, and also who I am. The song made us to know that it aint a must
  that you gonna come out from a wealthy family.   Anywhere you come from, what
  matters is who you are. I believe with my song, people will pick up courage
  and motivations to do something without fear or favors. Asking help from
  family or elsewhere, just believe you can do it yourself only.
