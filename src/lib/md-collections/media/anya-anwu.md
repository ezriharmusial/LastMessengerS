quote: A'bum nwa Anyanwu [I am the son of the Sun]
excerpt: I made this song called Anyanwu, cause the music really expresses how I
  feel inside, and also who I am. The song made us to know that it aint a must
  that you gonna come out from a wealthy family.   Anywhere you come from, what
  matters is who you are. I believe with my song, people will pick up courage
  and motivations to do something without fear or favors. Asking help from
  family or elsewhere, just believe you can do it yourself only.

(Intro)
Uh
Ask a cancer patient about the value of life
Before you cut your throat with a knife
Be happy stop being disappointed, Because life is one and  appointed Everyone get through the struggle and have to strive
This is what's called Life, Nigga

In my  fucking body nigga

Been waiting for the raining season
Deep raining season, that's when am gonna blow, nigga

Skillful Kennis being so strong in the street nigga
Being poor, being poor 
That's fucking old life nigga
I don't know that

That's lifestyle I never know
All I know is all about hustling in the street
Just to get the fucking money on my own, no body try to support this fucking nigga
Sheh you know, Sheh you know
You took me up nigga
I wake up in the morning try to knock on your door
knock the fucking door
3 times 4 times, you hear the fucking sounds 
That's me skillful kennis knocking, you open the fucking door and tell me go away
You called all the fucking security Upon this nigga,
Skillful Kennis  been so strong 
I took  the advantage on my own
Men am going home am going home
I started hustling on my own and no body try to support this  fucking nigga
I have been so strong in the street
I only  gat God on my self
I have served God for 7 days
I prayed for 7 days
I have fasted for 7 days just to make it to the top
You can't be me now
Right now am so spiritual in the street nigga
Every body want to be me 
They can't be am so Skillful 
They can't be me am so twisted
They can't be me am so spiritual
In the street in the street



(Chorus by Totty Dior)
Am the sunlight
Shining like a star
Superstar dream it can't stay far
Am so fast compare me to a jet
I hate fake nigga's 
Fuck nigga's and shit



(Verse 3)
Uh
Things are not meant to  always go your way  nigga
The mountains you walk on gat too steep to climb 
Just do not quit when life gets a little too hard for you
For the li-ght at the end of the tunnel is waiting for you nigga
Do not forget to smile through all of these hurdles
Just always keep your eyes on your joyous bundles
Be careful for all  you have before its too late
Because hurdles are placed in everyone's race nigga
