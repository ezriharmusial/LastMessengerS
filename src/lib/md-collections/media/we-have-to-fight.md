I see no justice uhhh! Corruption*2
I see justice no more
Corruption has taken the place of justice today, government are busy killing my people but dining and wining with criminals are we safe in this world, are we safe, are we safe
They wanna make sure nothing good is left in our homes
They wanna take away our joy, take away our peace, take away our treasures,
They wanna take away our lands, take away our pride,
But we have to fight them, tell me,
What is the need coming ina this world and living like a captive tell me,
What is the need coming ina this world and living like a slave*2
Brothers we really have to fight and fight and fight and free our people
I say we really have to fight and fight and fight and free our land*2
Ohh ohh ohh he! ye ye ye!
Watch out!!!!
What is the need coming in a this world and living like a captive tell me
What is the need coming Ina this world and living like a slave*2
No matter how hard they tried to kill our spirit, weâ€™re not giving up
No matter how long it takes be strong my people freedom is assured
I am beginning to see my risen sun shining on so bright
I am beginning to see all the dry bones coming back to life
I am beginning to see my oppressors running for their lives
I am beginning to see comrades in exile coming back to home,
But we really have to fight
Till fade!!!!!!!
