(Rap by Maya Skyler)
They know what they did ~they did what they know
Coveted Africa never-never gave a damn
looted our heritage en made away with trophies
caged Africans using many many lies
Divide and conquer~is your only strategy
Many years are gone while we were all asleep
It's a new dawn en I hear the cocka crowing
It's 7 in the morning
make hey while the Sun shines

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you
we need you
Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever

(Rap by Skillful Kennis SK)
Uh
Africa 4 Africa
Holop we back here
We now live in a better world
no pain,
no sorrow,
no grief
Jolly Jolly Jolly
no looting,
no suffering,
no lying
No hunger
After all say fuck death
happy happy happy
Let's unite to path no more
Africans, unite, unite, unite
Uh

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you
we need you
Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever

(Verse 3 by WhitneyZinny)
They lied, to us
deceived our ancestors
never gave a damn, no
killing us at will

(Verse 4 by WhitneyZinny)
I know, you know
we've been all freed
Ikuku ama n'onya ka anyi bu
Never let 'em fool you

(Verse 5 by ZehkEzehk)
Rain falls, Sun shines
Moon lights, Wind blows
Eke, Orie, Afo na Nkwo

(Verse 6 by Nneoma Ezelu)
Many years, gone by
We've been deceived
We waking up again
Do not let us down

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you
we need you
Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you
we need you
Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever
